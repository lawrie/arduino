/* use advanced timer input capture digital logic 
to automatically capture the asynchronous or very fast pulse.

Frees the CPU from busy waiting (user's program can continue
to execute while digital logic listens to the pulse.

Pulse should keep state for at least 3 CPU clock cycles to be 
captured.

This will work when 2 dedicated input capture pins are both 
connected to the incoming pulse source.

Maximum pulse width that can be measured is the period of the
PWM cycle of the timer. use analogWriteFrequency() to set this.

If several pulses arrive before reading, only the last 
events of leading and trailing edges will be stored in 
ICP registers.

The best way to read pulse is attachInterrupt on ICP2.
Read can be done without interrupt in time window after 
trailing edge of the pulse of interest 
and before leading edge of the next pulse.

pin with ICP1 captures the leading edge
pin with ICP2 captures the trailing edge

pin1, pin2 = pins of the input capture logic
state = HIGH to measure from rising to falling edge
state = LOW to measure from falling to rising edge

call this function after setting digtalWriteFrequency()
icpFilter() and similar functions which alter timer 
registers that control ICP.
